    // Key Projects and Impact as reflections
    reflections: [
        "This volunteering opportunity demonstrated the power of human-centered design principles in supporting community organizations. By facilitating design thinking workshops and documenting processes, we helped the trans youth organization secure government funding and implement sustainable volunteer strategies that continue to benefit LGBTQIA+ youth in Austin.",
        "The project's success highlighted how design thinking can create meaningful impact beyond traditional business contexts. The organization's ability to secure grants and improve their volunteer strategy based on our recommendations shows the lasting value of process optimization and user-centered approaches in community support work.",
        "This experience reinforced that sometimes the best solutions are not digital, but rather the application of design principles and human-centered design thinking to other realms. By focusing on understanding the real needs of people—whether they're trans youth seeking support, volunteers wanting to help, or staff managing complex processes—we can achieve the best possible results through thoughtful, empathetic problem-solving that transcends technology."
