                <p class="lead mb-4">
                    My design career began with an internship at an architecture firm in Buenos Aires. At the time I was still in technical school where I learned technical drawing, hardware and computer logic. I eventually moved into a webmaster design position at a Software Training Center, one of the first companies to begin offering online education during the internet boom.

                <p class="mb-4">
                    I transitioned to graphic design for advertising 15 years ago when I moved to California. About seven years ago I became more focused on experience design projects, I began contracting for tech agencies like Mutual Mobile and Jackrabbit Mobile in Texas.

                <p class="mb-4">
                    I am a hybrid designer, strategist, and most importantly I'm a doer. I thrive on solving all kinds of problems with the goal of crafting meaningful, aesthetic and pleasant experiences for users.
