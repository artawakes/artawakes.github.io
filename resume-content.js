        text: "I build design systems that actually work in the real world. At Instacart, I created their Tooling Design System from nothing and grew it to include over 80 Figma components and 45+ in Storybook. What I'm really proud of is how I brought design and engineering teams together, making sure everyone was speaking the same language.\n\nI'm looking for a remote or flexible role where I can continue growing design systems with a collaborative team.\n\nMy toolkit includes Figma, Storybook, and a deep understanding of accessibility standards, but my real superpower is translating between design system thinking and technical requirements to build a system that designers actually want to use."
